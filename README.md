# 🚨 Segment-42

> _Self-hosted container ops interface for hackers, devs, and mischief-makers._

**Segment-42** is a work-in-progress operations dashboard designed to give you full control over Docker containers from a clean web interface. It’s built with a Python backend and Vue.js frontend, with simplicity and extensibility at its core.

This is the MVP release — light, functional, and ready to scale.

---

## 🧪 MVP: Core Features

- ✅ List running/all containers
- ✅ Start, stop, restart containers
- ✅ View and tail logs in real-time
- ✅ Spawn new containers with minimal config
- ✅ Log all container actions to backend for future audit/reference
- ❌ No authentication yet (coming soon)

This release focuses on the essential control plane logic, with a lean stack and minimal dependencies — no Kubernetes, no orchestration bloat.

## 🚧 Planned Roadmap

> This is just the beginning.

| Version | Feature Set |

| `v3.x` | Network in/out tracking, alerts |
| `v4.x` | Multi-user support, RBAC (role-based access control) |
| `v5.x` | Honeypot mode: decoy containers + trap logic |

## 🧠 Philosophy

Segment-42 isn't just about dev convenience — it's built with the long-term goal of becoming a **security- and operations-focused control panel**. Future features will include honeypot behavior, stealth alerting, and system/network awareness baked into the UI.

If you're the kind of developer who wants **direct control**, **clean visibility**, and **zero hand-holding**, Segment-42 was built with you in mind.

## ☣️ Name Origin

Segment-42 refers to a fictional internal research division from a now-defunct cyber-ops agency.  
(Or at least, that's what the logs say...)
